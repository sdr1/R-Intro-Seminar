# Preliminaries

## What is the purpose of this guide?

To give you a basic understanding of how data is stored in a computer, how R works, how to compute summary statistics, and basic regressions. Since this is a basic guide, assume an asterisk after almost every line.

## How the guide is structured

Before we get to actual coding, it's useful to go over some general principles about coding and debugging. If you only care about the actual coding skip to the section called [An Intro to R Studio].

## What is R?

It's a program that allows users to analyze data, write academic papers, create websites, build applications, and tons of other stuff.

# Install R and R Studio

1)  Install R <https://cran.r-project.org/>. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE CORRECT VERSION.

-   To tell the type of Mac you have, go to the apple icon in the top left of the screen and click "About This Mac"
-   For an M1 Mac <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.2.0-arm64.pkg>
-   For an intel based mac <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/base/R-4.2.0.pkg>
-   For Windows <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>
-   For Linuix <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/>

Then install R Studio <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download> which is a integrated development environment for R. "It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management (R Stuido 2022)."

## Additional Mac Components

If you have a mac you likely need to install XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>, Xcode <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12>, and install command line developer tools from within Xcode. When you open Xcode for the first time there will be an option to do this. If not, in the terminal type:

If you don't know how to get to the terminal, you can search for it in Applications, Finder, or hit shift + command + u and then find the terminal application.

xcode-select --install

# Integrating with Other Programming Languages

You may wish to use other languages in addition to R. R and R Studio can do this, although sometimes the process of integrating another programming language takes too long and you're better of just using the languages separately.

## Java (with M1 Macs)

First, see if you can do whatever you want to do without using Java.

Second, if it's inevitable 1) I'm sorry and 2) what works currently may not work in a few months. The current solution to the problem is here in section 6.3.2. <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#macOS-packages>

## Fortran or C++

See <https://mac.r-project.org/tools/>

## Latex

Are you absolutely sure you want to do this? If so, go here <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>.
